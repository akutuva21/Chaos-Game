# Chaos Game
Our project is to create a Python program that creates fractals, given user input of weights.
The fractals are created by starting on one point of a polygon and moving either left or right.
The user is given the option of choosing which shape to pick, and then is allowed to adjust the preference towards left or right.
GUI libraries for Python will be used to create the visual interface for the user.
This program uses python 3.
