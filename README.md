# Chaos Game
Our project is to create a Python program that creates fractals, given a user input of number of sides and points to be plotted.The user is given the option of choosing which shape to pick, and then is allowed to adjust the preference towards certain points to affect the distribution of points in the resultant fractal.
The fractals are created by starting on one point of a polygon and plotting the midpoint between that point and a random vertex of the polygon. Next, the midpoint is used as the new point of reference to plot a new midpoint, and so on.
GUI libraries for Python along with PyPlot will be used to create the visual interface for the user.
This program uses Python 3.
