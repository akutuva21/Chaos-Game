#User picked point: if it's not in range, ask input again with user exception
#Random midpoint between random nodes
#Trace the image using line segments
'''General idea: these 3 points on the xy plane make an equilateral triange:P=(0,0), Q=(0,1),R=(1,0). Begin at P.
Set point p to 1, point Q to 2, R to 3. Let user pick 2 or 3. If 2, make a point halfway between P and Q. If 3, make 
a point halfway between p and r. Repeat.'''
'''The chaos game is meant to emulate a fractal, called the Sierpinski triangle. It can be applied to different shapes 
other than an equilateral triangle. This game represents the butterfly effect, as well as how chaos or randomness can 
eventually form order.'''
